        <h2>The world needs more Sandwich Artists!</h2>
        <p>The mission of our foundation is to create a new generation of Sandwich Artists. To make the world a better place. A sandwich is more than bread and filling. It's an art-form as old as teeth themselves, and and art-form that is under threat. We invite you to celebrate this art-form with your mouths, of course, but also with your hands, your heart and your mind.</p>
